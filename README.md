# Object-Detection-and-Tracking-using-Yolo-v-8-and-Deep-sort-Algorithm
Project is a Streamlit web app designed for real-time object detection and tracking. It uses the YOLOv8 model and Deep SORT algorithm to detect objects in images, videos, live camera feeds, and streamed video from a phone. The app processes these sources and displays the detected objects directly within the interface.
